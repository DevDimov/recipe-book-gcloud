# Recipe App with React, Node, SQL and Google Cloud

A minimalist recipe app for storing one's favourite recipes in one place. It uses React with Typescript on the front-end, and Node.js on the back-end. It stores recipe information and images in a Google Cloud SQL database.

## Demo

Deployed on Google Cloud with App Engine and Cloud Build services. To view and interact with the app via a web browser, please contact me.
